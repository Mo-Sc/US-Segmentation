# Repo for Ultrasound Segmentation Experiments

This repository collects different deep learning based algorithms used for ultrasound segmentation. It only contains custom scripts and instructions, so the original repositories are still required.

Currently:
- nnUNet (as used for pad segmentation pipeline project)
- MedSAM

### nnUnet

[Instructions](nnUNet/README.md)

### MedSAM / SAM

[Instructions](MedSAM/README.md)


## Dataset

To train the models, I used an annotated subset of the dataset collected in [this study](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.19.23297246). The dataset can be provided [on request](mailto:moritz.schillinger@fau.de).
